# Installing KubeVirt

The majority of KubeVirt was installed with [Kargo](https://github.com/ContainerCraft/Kargo) and Pulumi.
Some components were updated to the latest versions (eg CDI) but Kargo installed and configured the bulk of the deployments, operators, and services.

This folder is just for reference for some of the deployments that were installed from their bundles.
